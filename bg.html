            <h4>
              Sheep (pl.: sheep) or domestic sheep (Ovis aries) are a
              domesticated, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock.
              Although the term sheep can apply to other species in the genus
              Ovis, in everyday usage it almost always refers to domesticated
              sheep

            <h4>
              A bull is an intact (i.e., not castrated) adult male of the
              species Bos taurus (cattle). More muscular and aggressive than the
              females of the same species (i.e. cows proper), bulls have long
              been an important symbol in many religions, including for
              sacrifices.

            <h4>
              Elephants are the largest living land animals. Three living
              species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant
              (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis),
              and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus).

              Wait, if you thought Nature herself said that, you were quite
              close. Only, this Nature is one of the leading scientific journals
              in the world on life sciences and evolution. Evolution is a
              prerequisite for living organisms, which ultimately makes
